# Auth-SPA

Auth-SPA is part of a larger collection of boilerplates built using Next13, Firebase9 & Tailwind. Access them [here](https://github.com/simoncarriere/boilerplates)

### Disclaimers

- I tried to offer a balance between unopionated styling and a good starting point
- Every boilerplate denormalizes user datat into its own firebase collection on signup.

### The Boilerplates

1. Auth-SPA : Authentication for Single Page App using Email and/or Social Providers
2. Auth-Multipage (Coming Soon)
3. Auth-Subscription : Subscription Site biolerpalte, tracking subscribed / unsubscribed users on firebase.
4. Auth-Products (Coming Soon)
5. Auth-AccessControlledRooms :
